Here are some tips and tricks to help you avoid merging conflicts and maintain a clean and organized repository:

Create a branch: Always create a new branch when you start working on a new feature or bug fix. This will help keep your changes isolated from the main branch, and make it easier to merge your changes back in when you are finished.

Pull frequently: Always pull the latest changes from the main branch before starting work on a new feature or bug fix. This will help you avoid conflicts with other team members' changes.

Commit often: Make frequent, small commits with descriptive commit messages. This will help you keep track of your changes and make it easier to revert if necessary.

Write clear and concise commit messages: Your commit messages should be informative and easy to understand. Avoid using vague or generic commit messages such as "fixed bug" or "updated code."

Test before pushing: Always test your changes locally before pushing them to the remote repository. This will help you catch any issues before they are merged into the main branch.

Review pull requests: Always review pull requests from other team members before merging them into the main branch. This will help catch any potential conflicts or issues before they are merged.
